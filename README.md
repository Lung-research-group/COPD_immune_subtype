## Description
This repository contains the R codes used to generate all the figures in the article *Machine Learning-Assisted Multimodal Analysis Identifies an Immune-Driven COPD Subtype Associated with Increased Emphysema Across GOLD Stages*

The raw data used for the Flow Cytometry and Cytokine analyses have been deposited to Mendeley Data (human FACS data, accession number [XXXXX]). The raw data for scRNA-seq  were generated from control and COPD lungs, published by [Sauler et al. (2022)] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28062-9) (GEO accession: GSE136831). The raw data for spatial transcriptomics were produced from  GOLD1-2 and GOLD 3-4 COPD lungs, published by Polverino, et al (GEO accession: XXX)


The data processing workflows have been illustrated [here](https://github.com/lfranzen/spatial-lung-fibrosis/blob/master/doc/analysis_workflow_schematic_HsMm.pdf).
